How about we make a cryptocurrency called hugs?

I'm for this. Does a Hug enrich both people in the transaction?

We can have a server bot that allows us to give eachother "hugs"
I dunno, it's crypto for all I care we're giving each other a slice of death

I think you should get a Hug when you give a Hug, maybe?

I don't want to live in a world where devaluing Hugs is possible. I don't think flooding the market with hugs will negatively affect their inherent value.

Hugs are a form of labor In that the require physical presence and time
You can devalue hugs in a specific time frame, but the demand is inelastic and so is supply
Think oil, if OPEC wasnt a thing

I would contend that hug value is highly dependent on the supplier - there are people I am happy to be hugged by, people where I will socially tolerate their hug, and people who I do not want in my personal space. So (actual) hugs are not interchangeable, but crypto is total tulip economy nonsense, so go nuts.

I don't anticipate hugs (hug$) being something anyone can cash in for physical hugs.
